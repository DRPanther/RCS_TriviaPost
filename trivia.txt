* take more control for the recording of this song, and they were

* live", and that "If we hadn't been so messed up as a band, it could
* have been a turning point for us."

* That was the early nucleus of Toto. By the time they graduated from high
* school their band was headlining at high school functions. Jeff left to
* play with Sonny and Cher but David kept the band going. Jeff eventually
* became an in-demand session player and worked with Steely Dan on the
* "Katy Lied" LP. Meanwhile Paich and Porcaro were also working steadily
* as session players. In 1973 they decided to form a band. They were
* signed as Toto to Columbia and soon had a hit with "Hold the Line".
* Despite the superb musicianship critics were not kind to the band. The
* boys persevered and released the number two "Rosanna" and finally had a
* number one with "Africa". They garnered six Grammy awards after it was
* released and proved the critics wrong. "Rio" is a 1982 hit for Duran
* Duran, "Berlin" is a 1973 Lou reed release and "China" is a more recent
* Tori Amos song.

* veteran, starting at the Apollo at age five working with such greats as
* Sammy Davis and Bobby Darin and then doing numerous commercials. James
* Ingram was already familiar to the song's producer, Quincy Jones, who
* thought he would be perfect with Patti for "Baby, Come to Me". The pair

b. It's a Heartache
c. Total Eclipse of the Heart
d. Love is a Battlefield

* C - In an interview with Chas De Whalley for "Kerrang" magazine Bonnie
* explained that she had severed ties with managers Ronnie Scott and Steve
* Wolfe. She said that their production company would only let her sing
* songs that they had composed. Bonnie had been in a band called Mumbles
* that did material similar to Chaka Khan and Tina Turner but the team
* that managed her wanted to aim for the Nashville country album market.
* She hit number three in 1978 with "It's a Heartache" but after seven
* unsuccessful follow-up efforts she let her contract expire. Bonnie
* admired Jim Steinman of "Bat Out of Hell" fame, but wasn't sure if he'd
* consider producing her. They got together and he auditioned "Total
* Eclipse of the Heart" on his piano. He then compiled an array of
* outstanding musicians for a recording session including drummer Max
* Weinberg and Keyboardist Roy Bittan of the E Street Band and Rick
* Derringer. It was the first number one for the girl from Skewen, South
* Wales. "Love is a Battlefield" charted at number five for Pat Benetar on
* December 10, 1983. "Let's Hear it for the Boy" was a top five in 1984
* for Deneice Williams.

Which movie was the song from?

a. Flashdance
b. Valley Girl
c. Breakaway
d. Bad Boys

* A - Although not too many listeners had ever heard of Michael, he had
* been around the music business for a while before he had a hit with the
* song from "Flashdance". An in-demand session player, Michael had already
* worked with some of the biggest names in the business as well as
* composing some hits for Donna Summer, Diana Ross, Art Garfunkel and many
* more. When he was only 17 he became Stevie Wonder's guitar player for
* seven years and his collaboration with Wonder on "Saturn" had earned him
* a Grammy. One of Michael's other passions is horror films. He composed
* "Maniac" to describe a villain who hacked off heads for the "Halloween"
* series. He had forgotten that "Maniac" was on a tape he submitted to
* Phil Ramone and when Ramone called to tell him he loved it, he realized
* he'd have to change the lyrics. Sembello gave the song a revision along
* with Dennis Matkosky and it became the second song from the film to
* reach number one. Irene Cara hit number one earlier in 1983 with
* "Flashdance, What a Feeling".

band scored this chart-topper?

a. Culture Club
b. Dexy's Midnight Runners
c. Kajagoogoo

* B - In a 1982 interview with Lesley White for "The Face" guitarist Kevin
* Rowland said that if "Come on Eileen" wasn't a hit he would try to find
* another way to make a living. Rowland had originally thought of entering
* the priesthood but started forming bands when he was a youngster in
* Britain. The first incarnation of the band in 1978 sported an image
* inspired by the movie "Mean Streets". The group had a number one hit
* with "Geno". After the hit Rowland changed the look of the band to
* overalls, sweat bands and sandals. He changed the sound from a brass
* laden style to added fiddles and had his second number one with "Come on
* Eileen", knocking Michael Jackson from the top spot. "Time" was a top
* five for Culture Club in May, 1983. Kajagoogoo's top five was "Too Shy"
* in July, 1983 and After the Fire saw top five success in April, 1983
* with "Der Kommissar".

a. Every Breath you Take
b. De Do Do Do De Da Da Da
c. Don't Stand so Close to Me
d. Every Little Thing She Does is Magic

* A - Sting composed "Every Breath You Take". The song tied the Bee Gees
* "Night Fever" at eight weeks as number one. It was also Billboard's
* number one single of the year. In an interview with Christopher Connelly
* of "Rolling Stone" Andy Summers of The Police said that "Every Breath
* you Take" was one of the most difficult songs from the "Synchronicity"
* album to record. A synthesizer section was abandoned in favor of a
* smaller guitar based ensemble to provide the more appropriate backing
* for the song. Sting added that it was not meant to be a love song, but a
* nasty song about obsession and jealousy. Other hits from the same album
* include "King of Pain", "Synchronicity II" and "Wrapped Around your
* Finger". After the success of the album each member of the band started
* pursuing individual endeavors. "Don't Stand so Close to Me" and "De Do
* Do Do De Da Da Da" both peaked at number ten in 1981 and "Every Little
* Thing She Does is Magic" made it to number three the same year.

* "Innocent Man" he was recovered and took an upbeat approach to the
* project. The video featured Billy performing "Tell Her About It" on the
* "Ed Sullivan Show". "Uptown Girl" also came from the same album and was

* He formed a band called Longdancer and was one of the first bands signed
* to Elton John's new label, Rocket Records. While touring he chanced to
* have dinner in London and was served by an unemployed Scottish singer
* named Annie Lennox. Instead of ordering, Dave asked her to marry him and
* they became inseparable. They formed a group called Tourists and after
* touring and recording without success they called it quits while in
* Thailand. They soon regrouped in London and formed Eurythmics, recording
* "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" in an abandoned warehouse on an 8-track
* machine. They recorded the music tracks and then had to wait for a
* nearby factory to shut down to lay down the vocals. Thomas Dolby had his
* 1983 chart hit with the number five "She Blinded me with Science". Peet
* Coombs is a musician who was dining with Dave when he met Annie. Gordon

singer and front guitar player was Joan Jett. What was the name of her
band when she took the song to number one?

a. The Hearts
b. The Runaways
c. The Bluehearts
d. The Blackhearts

* D - Joan Jett and the Blackhearts was the name of the band on the record
* that had the number spot on the Billboard Hot 100 that date. The song
* created a quandary for radio disc jockeys. Some stations thought it was
* a punk style song. New Wave stations believed it was too much of a rock
* song. Adult contemporary charts weren't sure if it fit in their play
* list. Joan Jett had been touring constantly with her band since 1980 and
* cleared up the problem by pointing out "I play rock and roll". "I Love
* Rock 'n Roll" was originally done by the Arrows on the "B" side of one
* of their British singles. Jake Hooker and Alan Merrill wrote the song
* and explained that it was written as a response to the Rolling Stones'
* "It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)". They didn't like rock and
* roll, they loved rock and roll! The Arrows were confident that the song
* would be a hit but according to their manager, Mickey Most, the final
* production proved to be inadequate for release as an "A" side. Joan had
* been playing with an all-girl band called the Runaways and during a
* London tour she asked the Arrows if they could record it. The Runaways
* were not enthusiastic about it so Joan recorded it after the Runaways
* broke up and she formed the Blackhearts.

The week of July 24, 1982, saw "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor top the
charts. Which movie is this mega-hit theme from?

a. Rocky III
b. Rocky II
c. Rocky
d. Rocky IV

* A - Rocky Balboa takes on Mr. T as Clubber Lang in "Rocky III." "Eye of
* the Tiger" was the first "Rocky" movie to have a change of themes.
* Stallone originally considered Queens' "Another One Bites the Dust".
* Survivor keyboardist Jim Peterik had been in the business since 1970 and
* had enjoyed success when he was keyboardist for Ides of March when they
* had their hit tune "Vehicle". After that he had a dry spell then formed
* his own band. He related to Dennis Hunt of "The Los Angeles Times" that
* producer Tony Scotti played Stallone Survivor's "Premonition" album when
* he learned that Stallone was trying to get a more contemporary theme for
* his movies. Stallone was impressed with their sound and gave the band a
* challenge to compose the theme for the movie. Within 90 minutes of
* seeing a rough cut of "Rocky III" Peterik was inspired by the catch
* phrase from the movie and composed the song with guitarist Frankie
* Sullivan. In the movie there is a tiger roaring in the song, but Peterik
* insisted the sound effect be left off the single release.

Hall and Oates were lighting the charts on fire in the early eighties.
They enjoyed number one success in 1981 and started off 1982 with the
number one "I Can't Go for That" They also ended the year with the number
one song. Which song did they have at the number one spot December 18, 1982?

a. Did it in a Minute
b. One on One
c. Your Imagination
d. Maneater

* D - "Maneater" was the first single release from their "H2O" LP. In
* "Rockbill" magazine they said that the album was more "dancified" and
* streamlined than "Private Eyes". They were meticulous in the production
* to have every instrument mean something. MTV was allowed into the studio
* during the making of "H2O", providing viewers with a documentary look
* behind the scenes of an album production for the first time. The ensuing
* video for "Maneater" caused a slight controversy because the image of a
* female superimposed on a jaguar was termed misogynous by some. Hall and
* Oates conceded that they were more comfortable with the audio aspect of
* the business but also understood videos were necessary in the MTV age.
* They contend that the video made the best use of the video medium for
* the song. "Did it in a Minute" reached number nine and "Your
* Imagination" topped out at 33 in 1982. "One on One" was a number seven
* for the duo in 1983.

"Up Where We belong". Which movie is it from?

a. First Blood
b. Top Gun
c. An Officer and a Gentleman
d. Personal Best

* C - "Up Where We belong" was part of the film score to "An Officer and a
* Gentleman". The song brought together interesting artists and
* songwriters. Jennifer Warnes was a flower child who had never met Joe
* Cocker until the evening they recorded the song. Director Taylor
* Hackford originally wanted to find music from existing artists such as
* Pat Benatar, Dire Straits or Van Morrison, but as production wrapped he
* realized the movie required an original score. He prevailed upon
* lyricist Will Jennings who listened to Jack Nitzsche's score and
* believed he could put lyrics to it. Buffy Sainte-Marie also has writing
* credit. Within a few days the demo was on Hackford's desk. Jennifer
* Warnes had recently sung "It Goes Like it Goes" for the film "Norma Rae"
* and a friend of Hackford recommended her, but Hackford initially balked.
* When it was suggested she sing it with Joe Cocker he became interested.
* Fortunately Cocker was on tour in the Pacific Northwest and consented to
* fly down, record the song and fly back to continue his tour. Producer
* Don Simpson requested "Up Where We Belong" be cut from the film but
* Hackford prevailed. The song won an Oscar and the Golden Globe for Best
* Song.

number one artists?

a. Underground
b. Who Can it be Now?
c. It's a Mistake
d. Overkill

* composed the song. He met guitarist Ron Strykert while in La Troube
* University and soon they formed a band, performing regularly at the
* Cricketers Arms Hotel in Melbourne. It wasn't long before a CBS Records
* exec introduced them to American record producer Peter McIan. McIan
* produced the band's "Business as Usual" album and decided to release
* "Who Can it Be Now" as a single. To promote the record they were hired
* on as the opening act for a Fleetwood Mac tour. MTV finally got on board
* playing the video and the song started a 16-week climb to number one. In
* 1983 "Overkill" reached number three and "It's a Mistake" reached number
* six. "Underground" was a number 20 in 1983 for the boys from down under.

a. Journey
b. Air Supply
c. Chicago
d. Dazz Band

* C - Chicago took a brief departure from the business after a string of
* hits in the seventies. Columbia dropped the band even though Chicago had
* generated over $160,000,000 in album sales. The band switched to Full
* Moon/Warner Brothers in 1982 and their first release for the label was
* "Chicago 16". "Hard to Say I'm Sorry" from the LP is on the soundtrack
* to the movie "Summer Lovers". While the movie was not well received,
* Chicago's contribution, composed by bass player Peter Cetera and and the
* band's producer David Foster, fared much better. It stalled at number
* five for several weeks but after it was on the charts for 15 weeks it
* finally made it to number one. Keyboardist Bobby Lamm told "Billboard"
* he believes the song introduced the band to an audience of younger
* listeners. Air Supply was number five behind Chicago with "Even the
* Nights are Better". Dazz Band had a top five in July, 1982, with "Let it
* Whip" and Journey had a top five in March, 1982 with the number two
* "Open Arms".

emerged with this top hit?

a. Toto
b. Quarterflash
c. The Human League
d. Culture Club

* C - "Don't You Want Me" is the first English synthesizer single to make
* it to number one. Prior to The Human League British new wave bands had
* difficulty denting the Billboard Hot 100. The band started a small scale
* New Wave British Invasion. Human League originally formed in Sheffield
* in 1977. Several lineup changes took place and by 1980 leader Phil Oakey
* had the idea that having two girls to do backing harmonies and provide
* stage appeal would give the band a unique feel. Oakey located two high
* school aged girls in a disco and with their parents' permission the
* girls accompanied the band to Germany for a committed engagement. The
* group was soon offered a contract with Virgin Records and had a British
* top ten with "Love Action (I Believe in Love)". Their third single from
* the "Dare" album was "Don't You Want Me" which hit number one in England
* months before it topped the US Billboard charts. Quarterflash took
* "Harden My heart" to the top five in February, 1982. Culture Club took
* "Do You Really want to Hurt Me" to the top five in 1983. Toto's top five
* in 1983 was "Africa".

take to the top of the charts on November 27, 1982?

a. Hold Me
b. All Night Long (All Night)
c. Truly
d. Penny Lover

* C - Lionel Richie took "Truly" to the top in November. Lionel's
* grandmother, Adelaide, was a popular classically trained music teacher
* in his native Tuskegee. Lionel enjoyed singing in the choir but resisted
* attempts by his family to learn an instrument. A deeply religious person
* who was an alter boy at the Episcopal Church, he almost followed a
* clergy calling rather than a musical career. In a 1985 "Ebony" interview
* Lionel told Robert E. Johnson that although he didn't seek the
* priesthood he is quick to acknowledge that his faith is what guides his
* songwriting. His songwriting helped him to propel the Commodores to the
* top of the charts. Because he was the group's songwriter all the press
* attention was focused on Lionel. After he composed the number one "Lady"
* for Kenny Rogers his fame grew and eventually he parted ways with the
* Commodores. "Truly" is the first single from Richie's first eponymous
* album that was recorded over nine months on the Motown label. "All Night
* Long (All Night)" is a 1983 number one for Richie. "Penny Lover" is
* another 1983 release. "Hold Me" is a September, 1982, number for for
* Fleetwood Mac.

* members' input during the "Abracadabra" sessions. Approaching forty when

According to Billboard, what was the Number 1 song in the United States in
the 1980's?

a. Physical
b. Another Brick in The Wall
c. Billie Jean
d. Maneater

* A - "Physical" is a song by British-born Australian singer Olivia Newton-
* John for her twelfth studio album Physical. It was released in September
* 1981 by MCA Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written
* by Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick, who had originally intended to offer it
* to British singer-songwriter Rod Stewart, and produced by John Farrar. The
* song had also been offered to Tina Turner by her manager Roger Davies, but
* when Turner declined, Davies gave the song to Newton-John, another of his
* clients.
*
* The song was an immediate success, shipping two million copies in the United
* States, where it was certified Platinum and spent 10 weeks at #1 on the
* Billboard Hot 100. "Physical" ultimately became Newton-John's biggest
* American hit and cemented her legacy as a pop superstar, a journey that
* began when she crossed over from her earlier country-pop roots. The song's
* suggestive lyrics, which even caused it to be banned in some markets, helped
* change Newton-John's longstanding clean-cut image, replacing it with a sexy,
* assertive persona that was strengthened with follow-up hits such as "Make A
* Move On Me", "Twist of Fate" and "Soul Kiss". The song's guitar solo was
* performed by Steve Lukather.
